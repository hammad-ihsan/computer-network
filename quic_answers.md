# QUIC Analysis:

## Q1. What is the name of website?
The website is identified from the SNI extension in the ClientHello.  
**Website:** `www.youtube.com`

---

## Q2. Find the packet that contains the Initial QUIC handshake. What information is exchanged here?
- **Packet:** 315  
- **Type:** Initial QUIC packet  
- **Information exchanged:**  
  - TLS **ClientHello**  
  - Proposed cipher suites (3 suites offered)  
  - Key share values: X25519MLKEM768, x25519, secp256r1  
  - Supported version: TLS 1.3  
  - QUIC transport parameters  
  - Connection IDs (DCID, SCID)  

---

## Q3. Identify the QUIC packet that contains the TLS ClientHello.
The TLS ClientHello is embedded inside the Initial QUIC packet:  
- **Packet:** 315 
- Path: `QUIC → CRYPTO → TLSv1.3 Handshake → Client Hello`

---

## Q4. Which QUIC version is used in your trace?
From the QUIC header in Packet 315:  
**Version:** 1 (0x00000001) → IETF QUIC v1 (used for HTTP/3)

---

## Q5. Locate the packet where 0-RTT or 1-RTT keys are first used.
The first **QUIC 1-RTT Protected** packet marks the start of encrypted communication.  
This packet indicates the use of 1-RTT keys for secure application data transfer.  

---

## Q6. Find the first packet that carries application data (HTTP/3). How does this differ from HTTP over TCP?
- The first **1-RTT Protected packet with Stream Frame** carries the HTTP/3 application data.  

**Differences from HTTP over TCP:**  
- QUIC runs on **UDP** instead of TCP.  
- TLS 1.3 encryption is built directly into QUIC.  
- Multiplexing streams avoids head-of-line blocking.  
- Faster connection setup is possible (0-RTT / 1-RTT).
